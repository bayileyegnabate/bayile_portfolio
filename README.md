##  [Project 1: Mapping Earthquakes](https://github.com/bayileyegnabate/mapping_earthquakes)
The goal of this project was to visualize Earthquakes all around the world based on their magnitudes
- use [https://geojson.org/](GeoJSON) earthquake data from [https://www.usgs.gov/](USGS) website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitude of earthquakes for the last seven days
- use JavaScript and the [https://d3js.org/](D3.js) library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data 
- use [https://leafletjs.com/](Leaflet) to plot the data on a [https://www.mapbox.com/](Mapbox) map through an API request and add interactivity

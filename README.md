##  [Project 1: Mapping Earthquakes](https://github.com/bayileyegnabate/mapping_earthquakes)
_The goal of this project was to visualize Earthquakes all around the world based on their magnitudes_
- use [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) earthquake data from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/) website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitude of earthquakes for the last seven days
- use JavaScript and the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data 
- use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to plot the data on a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) map through an API request and add interactivity

## [Project 2: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction](https://github.com/bayileyegnabate/cryptocurrency_price_prediction)
_The main goal of this project (a team project) was to use machine learning to predict next-day closing price of the top crypto coins_
- use [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/crypto/) to gather historical data 
- store historical data using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/)
- use [XGBOOST](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to predict Close prices and compare results with those obtained using the [LSTM model](https://keras.io/api/layers/recurrent_layers/lstm/)
- create dashboard using [Plotely Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)

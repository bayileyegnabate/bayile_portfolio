##  [Project 1: Mapping Earthquakes](https://github.com/bayileyegnabate/mapping_earthquakes)
The goal of this project was to visualize Earthquakes all around the world based on their magnitudes
- use [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) earthquake data from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/) website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitude of earthquakes for the last seven days
- use JavaScript and the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data 
- use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) lib to plot the data on a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) map through an API request and add interactivity
